# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML
By given Dataset, We building model to find whether the person have diabetes or not.
This is dataset is the set of people who have diabetes or not.

It has a attributes like gender                 
 1   age : Age of the person    

 2   hypertension : If a person have high BP its YES otherwise its      NO.

 3   heart_disease   : If a person have a heart diseases its YES otherwise its NO.   

 4   smoking_history  : It gives the details of whether the person current smoker or before smoker or not smoker etc.

 5   bmi      : Its Body Mass Index of the person            

 6   HbA1c_level  : Its Random Sugar Level varies from 0 to 10.        

 7   blood_glucose_level   : Blood Sugar level

 8   diabetes : By all this information its the prediction of whether they have diabetics or not(target variable)

 Result:

 Model is build using different algorithm and their metrics where found.

For Decision Tree:

 Accuracy: 0.9479541530588896
Precision: 0.6859375
Recall: 0.7372840690978887
F1 score: 0.7106845513413506

For Random Forest:

Accuracy: 0.9699623489276725
Precision: 0.9498018494055482
Recall: 0.6900191938579654
F1 score: 0.7993329627570873

For Gradient Booster:

Accuracy: 0.9713352609572942
Precision: 0.979381443298969
Recall: 0.6837811900191939
F1 score: 0.8053122350946594

For XG Booster:

Accuracy: 0.9699623489276725
Precision: 0.9373795761078998
Recall: 0.7003358925143954
F1 score: 0.8017028288931612

So, I go with Random Forest Algorithm for the maximum accuracy and recall value.
